\section{Sentences}

\begin{itemize}
  \item TSM enjoys both high performance and high efficiency.
  \item It consumes 3  less computation than the ECO family, 6  less computation than ..., while achieving better performance on ...
  \item While this problem has received over 30 years of study, we may ask why reliable methods are still not readily available. Our insight is that the previous temporal models of human motion have not captured the complexity and variability of real human motions due to insufficient training data.
  \item Generally, the grid-based methods are more computationally efficient but the inevitable information loss degrades the fine-grained localization accuracy, while the point-based methods have higher computation cost but could easily achieve larger receptive field by the point set abstraction.
\end{itemize}
